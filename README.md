# Wall-E Compiler  

## 📌 Description  
Wall-E Compiler is a new programming language designed to allow users to create their own **pixel art** using code. It is aimed at **programming and digital art enthusiasts**, offering a unique combination of structured programming and visual creativity.  

## ✨ Features  
- **Integrated text editor** for writing code in Wall-E Compiler.  
- **Graphical interface** to visualize pixel art progress dynamically.  
- **Support for `.gw` files**, with **import and export** functionality to save and load creations.  

## 🔧 Installation  
Wall-E Compiler is developed in **Windows Forms**, requiring:  
- **Operating System:** Windows  
- **Framework:** .NET 6.0 or later  
- **Development Environment:** Visual Studio (recommended)  

### 🏁 Steps to Run  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
   cd Wall-E-Compiler
### 🛠 Code Structure
The project is organized into two main parts:

📂 Visual/ → Contains everything related to the graphical user interface. 📂 Compiler/ → Contains the compiler with the following features:

ASTExecutor: Executes the syntax tree generated by the compiler.

Recursive descent LL(1) parser: Uses an LL(1) grammar and calls lexer tokens lazily to improve efficiency.

### 🚀 Usage
Write code in the editor and execute it to see the pixel art result.

Save and load projects in .gw format.

Modify the code to experiment with different patterns and colors.
